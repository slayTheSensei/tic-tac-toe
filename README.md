Kyle's Tic Tac Toe

A very simple game of tic tac toe

The engine of this game is primarily made up of jquery event handlers.

I utilized flexbox and grid to create the layout of the game.


My design process was as follows:
Created the wireframe of the projects bones
started my with the css flexbox design
Create game logic and win logic using jquery event handlers
Sent game data to the api by passing JSON data through event handlers

Functioning game. Gameboard and navbar meet bare minimum requirements.

Wish I had more time to polish the game.

*NOTE: For some reason the game functions perfectly well when played on a local front end server. However, when deployed to github pages, I can only view HTML code.
